# pygame_learning

I've been following a few bloggers to learn how to write game code using pygame, thanks to their sharing！
  
The games that have been uploaded so far:
  1.PLANE WAR ( I will try to add blood deductions later on.)
  2.SNAKE  (I will beautify the page, design more kinds of fruits and more complex maps.)

I would appreciate it if you would contact me for suggestions for changes!

Thank you for the following videos, they are very helpful：
